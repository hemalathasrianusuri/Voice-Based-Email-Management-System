In todayâ€™s highly competitive world, effective communication serves as the cornerstone
of sharing essential information, particularly within the realm of business. Email com-
munication has become an integral part of our daily work routine, occupying a significant
portion of our time, encompassing tasks such as reading, composing, and sending mes-
sages. It is through email that we often transmit important and confidential information.
Regrettably, this convenience is not uniformly accessible to everyone. There are so many
disabled people worldwide who face significant challenges when it comes to using email.
This project endeavors to address this pressing issue by introducing a Voice-Based Email
Management System. This innovative system harnesses state-of-the-art voice recognition
and natural language processing technologies to empower disabled people, enabling them
to effortlessly compose, send, and receive emails using their voice, breaking down barriers
and making email communication more accessible. The project underlines the signifi-
cance of inclusive design, ensuring that both disabled and able-bodied users can interact
with the system effortlessly. The Voice-Based Email Management System serves as a vi-
tal tool for enhancing communication in an increasingly competitive world, particularly
for disabled persons. So, we want to made a Voice-Based Email Management System. It
listens to your voice, turns it into text, and sends emails for you. It also reads your emails
out loud. This system is designed to be super easy for blind people and handicapped
persons to use, making email accessible to everyone.

Currently working on enhancing system functionalities and optimizing performance for better user experience
